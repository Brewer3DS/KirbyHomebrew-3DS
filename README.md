## KirbyHomebrew-3DS
Makes Kirby Triple Deluxe a homebrew exploit

This homebrew exploit is still a work in progress! THIS EXPLOIT WILL BE RELEASED AFTER IT'S FINISHED AND WORKING!
Exploit works with any region so it's region-free. Unfortunately, this will not work with the cartidge version but will for the eshop version (The one you get from the eshop and appears on your HOME menu.)

# How to install
You need to have the boot.3dsx file on your SD card and Kirby: Triple Deluxe installed/purchased in your 3DS already.
If you don't have the boot.3dsx file, go here: https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/download/v2.1.0/boot.3dsx
If you don't have Kirby Triple Deluxe installed, go to the Nintendo EShop on your HOME menu and search up Kirby Triple Deluxe. The rest is up to you.

## DO NOT FOLLOW THESES STEPS BELOW!!!!!!
1. Power off the 3DS and hold down the power and select button at the same time to open up the Luma3DS Configuration menu and go to Enable game patching and press A to turn it on and then press START to apply the changes and restart the 3DS
2. Power off the 3DS again and put the SD Card into your computer and go to the releases and click on the file and not the zip file. (DO NOT DO THIS STEP, I WAS KIDDING!!)
3. Once you have the file(boot.3dsx), move(copy) the file(boot.3ds) to the 3DS SD Card in this path, luma/titles/Title ID of your Kirby Triple Deluxe game/romfs/ until I know to put it at..
4. DON'T FOLLOW THESES STEPS CAUSE THIS WON'T WORK!!
